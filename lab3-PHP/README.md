# SDEV-300 LAB 3


As part of the submission for this Lab, you will create your own Web page that uses both HTML and PHP 
to create several different tables providing specific information. You will get a chance to use most of the 
concepts you studied so far in this course as you will apply both HTML and PHP code to this exercise. 
You may enhance your HTML display with CSS style sheets as desired but that is not required. 
Specifically, you will create a PHP Web application that provides 2 different tables. You will use your 
design skills to determine the size and organization of the resulting tables. 
The first table should include the results of using PHP to calculate several mathematical and 
trigonometric functions. Specifically, the following formulas should be implemented as functions in PHP: 
 slope-intercept equation for a line: y = mx+b 
 Surface Area of Sphere: A = 4R2 
 Distance an object travels for given velocity and time : d = vt 



The second table should include a famous quote (or quote that you like) and slightly modified versions 
of that quote using PHP String functions.  You should use existing PHP functionality (e.g. built-in 
functions) to modify the quote.
