 Building Secure Web Applications

 A hands-on study of best practices and strategies for building
secure applications for the web. The objective is to defend against web application vulnerabilities. Topics include
web application architecture, common threats and trends, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, input validation,
and business logic flaws.


#lab2
a review or learning of HTML/CSS with a web form.
I created a Ecom Store for High performance computer mice.

# lab3
basic php with math functions,outputting many results in a table.

# lab7
A semi-complex php web app built from scratch. Uses MySQL with PHP to create a CRUD app.
Secuity is obviously a big concern so careful coding had to be used to prevent SQL injection.
Data integrity checks for all of the forms so that only acceptable data can be used. Error handling with useful info feedback.

A secuity question check after the user enters in a good username/password combo. 
* The ability to edit the user information
* The abilty for the user to delete thier account
*proper data sanitization

## lab7 
Running a scan on a provided web app, tcoupled with doing a doing a  manual code review for security concerns.
*creating a report on the concerns and how they were successfully patched.
